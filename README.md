## The language of the divine vision

Learn Avesta at your own pace.

## FAQ

### Q: What is Avesta?

`Avesta` or `Avestan` is the mother language for French, German, English, Latin and many other languages. It's comparable to the `Sanskrit` language.

### Q: How complete and accurate is the information provided on the companion website?

[The companion website](https://learn-avesta.org) is a work in progress. It reflects only my own current understanding of the language. Feel free to [contribute](./CONTRIBUTING.md) or raise [issues](https://github.com/hdorgeval/learn-avesta/issues) if you find something wrong or have improvement to suggest : I'd love to get your insights.

### Q: What is the target audience?

Anyone who wants to learn Avesta with no prior knowledge.

### Q: How do I get started?

Go to the [companion website](https://learn-avesta.org) and start learning. The App is designed for a progressive and smooth learning experience. You will go through a set of interactive activities : the first one consist in manually exploring each character of the alphabet.
Each time you reload the App, you will have a different set of characters to explore.

### Q: How do I contribute?

You can contribute in many ways. If you find something wrong or have improvement to suggest, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/hdorgeval/learn-avesta/issues) or [contribute](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Q: What is your vision for the future?

My plan, is to create "by hand" a set of activities that will serve to train a neural network for automatic speech synthesis, speech recognition, text translation, etc... The idea will be to use existing tools given by Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence technologies to provide, in fine, some kind of personal mentor to the learner.

This vision is ambitious, and I hope to achieve it.

In this context, you can imagine that the current version of the App only scratches the surface of what I plan to do.
