## FAQ

### Q: What is Avesta?

`Avesta` or `Avestan` is the mother language for French, German, English, Latin and many other languages. It's comparable to the `Sanskrit` language.

### Q: How complete and accurate is the information provided on the companion website?

[The companion website](https://learn-avesta.org) is a work in progress. It reflects only my own current understanding of the language. Feel free to [contribute](./CONTRIBUTING.md) or raise [issues](https://github.com/hdorgeval/learn-avesta/issues) if you find something wrong.
